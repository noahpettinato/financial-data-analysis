# Project Title: Financial Data Analysis with ARIMA Forecasting

## Overview
This project analyzes financial market data using time series analysis and predictive modeling. The core of the project is an ARIMA model that forecasts future stock prices based on historical closing prices.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Reads financial market data from a provided dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes trends and key statistics.
- **ARIMA Model Implementation:** Trains a predictive model for stock price forecasting.
- **Evaluation:** Compares forecasted prices with actual values.
- **Visualization:** Plots historical vs. predicted prices.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn yfinance statsmodels
```

## Usage
1. Run the script to load and preprocess the data.
2. The ARIMA model will generate stock price forecasts.
3. The script will output performance metrics and visualization plots.

## Results
The project successfully predicts stock price trends using ARIMA, providing insights into market movements.
