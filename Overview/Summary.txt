PROJECT SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------
This project is a comprehensive time series analysis of stock market closing prices, utilizing ARIMA modeling for forecasting. The workflow included data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model selection. After preparing the dataset, missing values were handled, trends and seasonality were analyzed, and an ARIMA(5,1,0) model was implemented. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using key statistical metrics, and iterative improvements were made to enhance accuracy. The project was thoroughly documented, with findings compiled into a structured report for presentation. The final deliverable provides insights into stock price trends and the predictive capabilities of ARIMA models in financial forecasting.
