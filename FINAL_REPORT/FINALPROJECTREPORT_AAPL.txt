Final Project Report: AAPL Stock Data Analysis & Forecasting
=============================================================
Date: March 29, 2025

-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------
This project analyzes historical AAPL stock data spanning from January 1, 2015 
to December 30, 2021. The work is divided into the following phases:
• Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Phase 3: Stationarity Testing & Preprocessing
• Phase 4: Forecasting Model Development
• Phase 5: Model Validation & Interpretation

This final report documents the methodology, key findings, model performance, 
and future improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------
2. Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Data Collection & Cleaning:
• Data was downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
• The CSV file was cleaned by skipping extra header rows and converting the 
  "Date" column into a datetime index.
• Final Dataset: 1,762 entries from 2015-01-02 to 2021-12-30 with variables: 
  Close, High, Low, Open, Volume. No missing values were found.

Descriptive Statistics:
• Mean Close Price: 58.83 USD
• Standard Deviation: 40.14 USD
• Range: 20.67 USD to 177.23 USD

Visual Insights:
• Closing Price Plot: Reveals a strong upward trend with noticeable fluctuations.
• Daily Returns: Calculated via percentage changes; indicate periods of high volatility.
• Monthly Average Price: Suggests seasonal behavior, with higher averages near 
  year-end.

-------------------------------------------------------------
3. Phase 3: Stationarity Testing & Preprocessing
-------------------------------------------------------------
Methodology:
• The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on the original Close series yielded an 
  ADF Statistic of 2.03 and a p-value of 0.9987, indicating non-stationarity.
• First-order differencing was applied to the Close series.
• The ADF test on the differenced series produced an ADF Statistic of -8.69 and 
  a p-value of 4.01e-14, confirming stationarity.

Visual Validation:
• The plot of the differenced series shows fluctuations centered around zero, 
  indicating the trend has been removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------
4. Phase 4: Forecasting Model Development
-------------------------------------------------------------
Data Split:
• The dataset was split into:
  - Training Set: 90% (1,585 observations)
  - Test Set: 10% (177 observations)

Model Building:
• An initial ARIMA(1,1,1) model was tested, followed by adjustments leading 
  to the selection of an ARIMA(5,2,1) model.
• The final model summary indicated statistically significant coefficients 
  (e.g., AR terms, MA term) and acceptable AIC/BIC values.
  
Forecasting:
• Forecasts were generated for the test period.
• Error Metrics:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 74.19
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 6.64
• A plot of actual vs. forecasted closing prices shows the model captures 
  the overall trend, though extreme spikes are challenging.

-------------------------------------------------------------
5. Phase 5: Model Validation & Interpretation
-------------------------------------------------------------
Diagnostics:
• Residual analysis (histogram, time-series plot, and ACF plot) indicated that 
  residuals are approximately white noise.
• Alternative ARIMA orders were explored; ARIMA(5,2,1) was found to be the best 
  fit based on diagnostic tests and error metrics.

Key Observations:
• AAPL stock data exhibits a strong upward trend and heightened volatility, 
  particularly in 2020–2021.
• The final ARIMA model forecasts the overall trend well, although some deviations 
  occur during periods of extreme market movement.

-------------------------------------------------------------
6. Conclusions & Future Work
-------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusions:
• The project successfully processed and analyzed historical AAPL stock data.
• Stationarity was achieved through first-order differencing.
• The ARIMA(5,2,1) model provided reasonable forecasts, capturing the overall trend.
• Residual diagnostics confirmed that the model sufficiently captured the data’s 
  primary dynamics.

Future Improvements:
• Model Refinement: Experiment with SARIMA to better account for seasonal patterns.
• Feature Engineering: Incorporate exogenous variables (e.g., market indices, economic 
  indicators) to improve forecasting accuracy.
• Advanced Techniques: Explore machine learning or deep learning approaches (e.g., 
  LSTM networks) for time series forecasting.

7. Final Thoughts
-------------------------------------------------------------
This comprehensive analysis—from data collection and EDA to forecasting and 
model validation—provides robust insights into AAPL's historical performance and 
potential future trends. The methodologies and findings presented here lay a 
strong foundation for further research or practical applications in financial 
decision-making.
