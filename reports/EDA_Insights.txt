========================================================================

Overview:
---------
This document summarizes the findings from the EDA performed on the historical 
AAPL stock data spanning from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2021. The 
analysis was conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, and the key insights 
are detailed below.

        Median: 41.66, 75th Percentile: 74.82, Max: 178.01
  - **Volume:** 
      - Mean: 138,059,200, Std: 69,779,220, Min: 41,000,000,
        25th Percentile: 90,504,620, Median: 118,970,800,
        75th Percentile: 165,415,900, Max: 648,825,200

2. Closing Price Trend:
-----------------------
- The closing price generally shows an upward trend over the analyzed period.
- Notable observations:
  - **Spikes:** Significant spikes in stock price are observed between 2018 and 2019.
  - **Dip:** There is a noticeable dip between 2019 and 2021.
  - Post-dip, the price shows a consistent upward increase.
  
3. Daily Returns & Volatility:
------------------------------
- **Daily Returns:**
  - Daily percentage changes were calculated using `df["Close"].pct_change()`.
- **Volatility Insights:**
  - The highest volatility (largest daily returns) is observed between 2020 and 2021.
  - The second highest volatility is observed between 2019 and 2020.
  - A third period of elevated volatility occurs again during 2020-2021.
  - The rest of the periods show relatively stable daily changes.

4. Seasonality:
---------------
- **Monthly Analysis:**
  - Average monthly closing prices indicate that the stock price tends 
    to increase as the year progresses.
  - **Highest Average Prices:** Observed in December.
  - **Comparative Insights:**
    - January typically shows lower average prices compared to December, 
      which may be attributed to the holiday effect.
    - There is a steady increase from February through October, with a small 
      dip in October before rising again in November and December.

Summary:
-----------------------
- The dataset is clean with no missing values.
- The statistical summary provides a clear picture of the distribution and 
  variability of stock prices and volume.
- Trends and volatility analysis highlight key market events, such as the 
  upward trend overall, dips, and spikes in specific periods.
- Seasonal patterns suggest potential cyclical behavior that may influence 
  forecasting models.

Next Phase:
-----------
- **Phase 3: Stationarity Testing & Preprocessing:**  
  The next step will be to test for stationarity (using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller 
  test) and, if needed, transform the data (e.g., differencing) to prepare it for 
  forecasting models like ARIMA.
