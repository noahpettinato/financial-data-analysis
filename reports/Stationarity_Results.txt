Stationarity Analysis for AAPL Stock Data (2015-2021)
==========================================================================

Overview:
---------
This document summarizes the stationarity testing and preprocessing performed 
on the historical AAPL stock data spanning from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2021. 
The analysis was conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, and the key insights 
are detailed below.

1. Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test on Original Series:
---------------------------------------------------------
- **Initial Stationarity Test (Close Prices)**:
  - **ADF Statistic:** 2.0334
  - **p-value:** 0.9987 ‚ùå **(Not Stationary)**
  - **Critical Values:**
    - 1%: -3.4341
    - 5%: -2.8632
    - 10%: -2.5677
  - **Conclusion:** The p-value is greater than 0.05, meaning we fail to reject the 
    null hypothesis. This confirms that the original closing price series is non-stationary 
    and requires transformation.

2. First-Order Differencing:
----------------------------
- **To remove trends and achieve stationarity, first-order differencing was applied.**
  - The transformed series is calculated as:  
    `df["Close_diff"] = df["Close"].diff()`
  - The first row becomes NaN and is removed.

3. ADF Test on First-Order Differenced Series:
----------------------------------------------
- **ADF Statistic (Differenced):** -8.6923
- **p-value (Differenced):** 4.009e-14 ‚úÖ **(Stationary)**
- **Critical Values:**
  - 1%: -3.4341
  - 5%: -2.8632
  - 10%: -2.5677
- **Conclusion:** The p-value is now significantly below 0.05, and the ADF statistic 
  is lower than all critical values. This confirms that the first-differenced series 
  is **stationary** and suitable for forecasting.

4. Observations from Differenced Series:
----------------------------------------
- The differenced series shows steady **positive and negative spikes** up until **2018**, 
  where volatility starts to increase.
- **2020-2021:** The largest spikes occur, indicating extreme market fluctuations.
- **Post-2021:** The differenced values remain higher than earlier years but are 
  relatively stable compared to 2020-2021.
- The increased volatility aligns with major market events like the COVID-19 pandemic 
  and economic uncertainty.

Summary:
--------
- **‚ùå The original closing price series was non-stationary (trending over time).**
- **‚úÖ First-order differencing successfully removed the trend, making the series stationary.**
- **üìà Volatility increased significantly after 2018, with extreme fluctuations in 2020-2021.**
- **üöÄ The dataset is now ready for forecasting using models like ARIMA.**
