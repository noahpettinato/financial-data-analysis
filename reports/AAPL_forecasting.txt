AAPL Stock Price Forecasting (2015-2021)
=============================================================

Overview:
---------
This document summarizes the ARIMA-based forecasting approach applied to the 
AAPL stock dataset from January 1, 2015, to December 30, 2021. The analysis was 
conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook titled `AAPL_Forecasting.ipynb`.

1. Data Loading & Structure:
----------------------------
- **Initial CSV Columns:** ['Price', 'Close', 'High', 'Low', 'Open', 'Volume']
- **Loaded Dataset Details:**
  - DatetimeIndex: 1762 entries (2015-01-02 to 2021-12-30)
  - Columns: Close, High, Low, Open, Volume
  - No missing values
- **Plot:** The closing price chart (2015-2021) shows a strong upward trend, 
  especially accelerating after 2018.

2. Train/Test Split:
--------------------
- **Split Ratio:** 90% training (1,585 rows), 10% testing (177 rows)
- **Training Set:** 2015-01-02 to ~2021-xx-xx
- **Test Set:** ~2021-xx-xx to 2021-12-30

3. Model Identification (ACF & PACF):
-------------------------------------
- **First Differencing:** From Phase 3, we know the series is non-stationary 
  and becomes stationary after first differencing (d=1).
- **ACF & PACF of Differenced Series:**  
  - Plots indicate relatively quick cutoffs near lag 1 for both ACF and PACF, 
    suggesting ARIMA(1,1,1) as a reasonable starting model.

4. ARIMA(1,1,1) Model Results:
------------------------------
- **SARIMAX Results (ARIMA(1,1,1)):**
  - **AR (ar.L1):** -0.3595 (p < 0.001)
  - **MA (ma.L1):** 0.2501 (p < 0.01)
  - **SigmaÂ²:** 1.5696
  - **AIC:** 5215.365
  - **BIC:** 5231.468
- **Key Observations:**
  - The Ljung-Box (L1) Q-test shows no significant autocorrelation at lag 1.
  - Jarque-Bera test indicates non-normal residuals (common in financial data).
  - The model captures the general trend but may have limitations 
    in capturing extreme volatility.

5. Forecasting & Visual Evaluation:
-----------------------------------
- **Forecast Period:** 177 steps (matching the test set).
- **Plot:** The forecast vs. actual test data shows that:
  - The model follows the overall upward trajectory.
  - Large spikes may be under/overestimated due to inherent volatility.

6. Residual Analysis:
---------------------
- **Residuals:**  
  - Appear to be centered around zero but show signs of heteroskedasticity 
    (consistent with financial time series).
- **ACF of Residuals:**  
  - Minimal autocorrelation, suggesting that the ARIMA(1,1,1) model 
    effectively captures the main patterns.

7. Conclusions & Next Steps:
----------------------------
- **Conclusions:**
  - ARIMA(1,1,1) provides a reasonable baseline forecast, aligning with 
    the differencing insights from Phase 3.
  - The strong upward trend is well-modeled, but large price fluctuations 
    remain challenging.

- **Potential Improvements:**
  1. **Parameter Tuning:** Try ARIMA(2,1,1) or ARIMA(1,1,2) to see if 
     AIC/BIC improve.
  2. **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA):** If monthly or quarterly seasonality 
     is detected, consider SARIMA for improved performance.
  3. **Additional Exogenous Variables:** Incorporate macroeconomic 
     factors (e.g., interest rates, market indices) for better context.
  4. **Other Models:** Explore advanced models like SARIMAX, 
     Prophet, or deep learning for potentially better forecasts.
